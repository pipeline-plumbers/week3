The image is a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in the us-east (Northern Virginia) region, showing public and private subnets, routing tables, and an Internet Gateway. This secures public and private resources within AWS. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

 VPC (MyVPC):
- CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
  - This defines the overall range of IP addresses available in this VPC. It allows for up to 65,536 IP addresses, which are divided into subnets.

 Subnets:
1. Public Subnets (highlighted in green):
   - CIDR ranges:
     - 10.100.1.0/24 (in us-east-1a)
     - 10.100.3.0/24 (in us-east-1b)
     - 10.100.5.0/24 (in us-east-1c)
   - Public subnets are exposed to the internet via the Internet Gateway (IGW), allowing resources in these subnets to communicate with the outside world.
   - Associated with IGW: These subnets have routes that allow traffic to and from the internet.

2. Private Subnets (highlighted in blue):
   - CIDR ranges:
     - 10.101.2.0/24 (in us-east-1a)
     - 10.101.4.0/24 (in us-east-1b)
     - 10.101.6.0/24 (in us-east-1c)
   - Private subnets do not have direct access to the internet, meaning the resources within these subnets (like databases) are isolated from public traffic.
   - Internal traffic only: A private route table routes traffic only within the VPC.

 Routing Tables:
1. Public Subnets Route Table:
   - Destination: 0.0.0.0/0 (to IGW) for internet traffic.
   - Local traffic (10.100.0.0/16) stays within the VPC.
   - This table allows instances in public subnets to access the internet.

2. Private Subnets Route Table:
   - Destination: 10.101.0.0/16
   - Route: Local traffic only, meaning instances in private subnets can communicate with other instances within the VPC but cannot directly access the internet.

 Internet Gateway (MyIGW):
- The Internet Gateway (IGW) allows resources in public subnets to communicate with the internet.
- Two-way traffic: This enables both incoming and outgoing internet traffic for instances within public subnets.

 Traffic Flow:
- Public subnets: Internet traffic can flow in and out through the IGW, making these subnets suitable for resources that require public accessibility (e.g., web servers).
- Private subnets: Only internal VPC traffic is allowed, so they are ideal for resources like databases or application servers that need to stay isolated.

 Summary:
- Public subnets: Exposed to the internet, suitable for web-facing resources.
- Private subnets: Isolated, suitable for internal resources (databases, backend systems).
- IGW: Manages internet connectivity for public subnets.
- Routing tables ensure correct traffic flow between the internet and internal resources, separating public and private resources.
